I&rsquo;m saving quite a bit myself, around $1000 monthly while still being able to pay for everything.  So if I receive the funds request I&rsquo;ll have no problem paying.  On the low side my net income is $2810, I say low because I&rsquo;ve factored in missing 2-3 days incase of emergencies and incase no overtime/bonus  is given, my company currently allows unlimited OT due to my position and the demand for it.  My current YTD average monthly income is $5992 or ($47,166.15 YTD as of 8/27/2010)   My bills include <br/><br/>$700 monthly to Jared&rsquo;s min payment is 435 (will be paid off by March) <br/>$400 car payment<br/>$200 Credit Card Payments <br/>$115 Car Insurance<br/>$60 Gas (I drive a Prius so this is generous allowance) <br/>$200 Cable/Internet/phone<br/><br/><br/><br/>My fianc&eacute;e who is in her last year of Law school (she graduates in May) will move here to Texas and that will increase our income as well.  We&rsquo;ve both committed to living with my parents (where I live currently) until we pay off the wedding.  The reason why I&rsquo;m able to bank the $1000 is because they do not charge me rent or make me pay for utilities or even food.  My cable bill is high because instead of going out all the time I spend it at home saving money.   I have over $40,000 in my retirement accounts so in a crunch I could always withdraw funds from them to pay back the loan.  I have been very responsible with my money but now need a little help to pay for the wedding.  My parents threw us an engagement party and our families gave us monetary gifts that totaled $5000 (which we still have and will pay for parts of the wedding), we&rsquo;ll receive at least the same in wedding gifts if not more. I choose the 5 year repayment to plan for the worst and should have no troubles paying this loan.  My credit history also reflects that I have an excellent payment history.    With this loan I would be able to pay for everything up front and not charge items to credit cards and even get discounts from wedding vendors if we pay cash.   I hope this explanation helps.<br/>",2189

I'm very pleased to see an opportunity like this where people can help other people and make a safe investment as well. I'm so sick of the banks and financial industry having all the power. That's why ""Damn the Man"".  The short story is after dealing with a computer error on my Home Depot payment,  (Citi Bank) which they owned up to and admitted there were some glitches, my payment posted late by less than 24 hours. They so conveniently raised my rate to the default of 29.99%. When I inquired and tried to get my rate reset, they said they have no control or ability to do that.  I've never had such a bad experience with any other company or my other Citi accounts.  I only need 2666.00 to pay off the Depot account, it's already been closed, I'm done with them. The balance will be used to consolidate 1 other card that is at 17%, about another $1750.00.  The remaining be paid back to lending club early, at this point I have no need for it, my remaining credit accounts are all at reasonable rates. FYI, the credit score listed is incorrect, I have CreditSecure with American Express and my combined Fico score as December 1st was 703, down from 730 over the last year  because my balances on a couple cards increased for business use and has not been paid down yet. I am self employed, my company is 2.5 years old and solid. We due, however have a fairly high overhead presently and are trying to reduce our existing CC debt which we used for start up and operating capital for the first 6 months. I welcome questions.

I've never been late on a payment, credit card or otherwise, and I've learned the hard way about money management.

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve Cornell’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎés alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wife’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎés part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means. We don’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎét own boats, motorcycles, SUVs, pool, big-screen TV, or other frivolous depreciating assets.  My volvo 10 years old, my wife’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎés is 8 years old; both paid for and running great!  We are working to pay down debt - our mortgage is conventional and we pay towards principal on all other debts each month.  Please contact me if you have any questions, and thank you for considering this request. God Speed!",2721

I took one out last year through Lending Club, which went very well. I have always made the payments on time and kept up other debt in the meanwhile. I had hoped to have the current loan paid off within the next six months. Unfortunately, due to matters beyond my control and which I am not at liberty to disclose, I was forced to take on additional debt over the course of the last six months. Now that the matter has been resolved, I can continue to pay off the existing loan and also pay down the new debt accrued at a fairly aggressive rate; however, I would prefer to secure a new loan for a slightly larger amount and longer term. My goal is to pay off the loan in 3 years or preferably less. With that said, I am requesting a five-year loan with the idea the unexpected can happen so having a lower monthly amount due to begin with will allow me to keep money in savings for the unknown and not have to rely on credit cards. I will also try to pay more than is due each month in order to pay off the loan as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>Using this new loan I am committed to: paying off the existing Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months; pay off all outstanding credit card and personal loan debt, and leave myself with only this new monthly loan, a small auto loan, monthly rent and some associated bills, such as heating, etc.<br/><br/>I would be willing to agree to a loan of a lesser amount. However, for the sake of credit upkeep and repair, my aim is for the full amount in order to close out any other existing loans, and pay off all existing credit card debt.<br/> Borrower added on 09/14/11 > Note to potential investors: I currently have a Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months and always paid on time. That loan is $415/month approximately. The new loan would pay off that 3-year loan and all other debt. The new terms would be only $10 more per month for a 5-year loan. I hope this very small ($10) adjustment per month and my history of paying this and all debt 100% on time will help you in your investment decision.  I will pay off the new loan, if received, before the 5-year term. The extended timeframe is merely a safety net, which allows me to pay the minimum due from time to time, though I plan to pay more than due each month 90% of the time, if not always.<br/>",2437

The income listed in not household but individual. This credit card has been paid off slowly from 22k to 7780 in a year and a half. The problem is everytime I make a huge payment, the credit card company lowers the credit limit to whatever I paid. For instance I made a 10k payment. Then they lowered the limit 10k. This affects my credit score and debt to ratio. I have never been late on a payment.  The credit card company claims that they have been affected by the economy and those whom filed chapter 13/7. So they are lowering credit limits to off set their loss. It's upsetting. I worked hard to have my credit score be in the excellent range, I never asked for a credit increase. They increased it, and when I used it with the intention to pay off in 2 years. They are now lowering it as I pay off, which affects me. I will cancel this card if my loan is funded. I have had that account for almost 13 years and this is the thanks I get from them. All the interest I have paid to them throughout the years has paid my debt probably 3 times over<br/>",1152

I graduated three years ago with my B.S. and have worked hard to improve my financial situation since. I have learned a good deal about investments and credit while trying to pay off my debts and purchasing a home (87% LTV). I actually did manage to pay off and close nine accounts (various credit cards and an auto loan) which amounted to half of my total 'bad' debt, but the remaining five credit accounts are not budging. I am at the point where I have tried long enough to get rid of them that I believe that I need to just wipe them out at once. I have eliminated the physical cards and have been living off of income only. I have never missed a payment on any debt and I have never been late making a payment so I consider myself no risk to lenders. I have a good-excellent borderline credit score.

I currently have three credit cards ($8400, 4200, and $600 balances). I would like to consolidate these debts into one payment for convenience as well as to maximize APR once promotional rate expires on these accounts.  My financial situation:  I have a solid 9 year credit history with no negative marks. I opened my first credit card in college and unlike many students developed my credit history wisely. Post-graduation, of my 6 revolving balances, I've paid off my two student loans, and have 3 revolving credit cards, the highest balances being $8400 most of which consists of a purchase and auto repairs for a car I no longer use (public transportation is great for wallet and environment!). I currently work as a paralegal and make $36,000 per year before OT, but also cater for added income, and I am very simple with my spending. I have health insurance coverage and do not plan any large expenses in near future. I always pay my bills first before all else, and my credit history reflects this.  My monthly budget: Salary: $2700.00 per month Mortgage/rent: $280.00 (I live with friends so rent is very cheap) Insurance: $56.00 Car expenses: $89.00 (use public transportation in Boston at $89.00 per month for train pass) Utilities: $100.00 (not part of rental agreement. Rent is one flat fee) Food, entertainment: $160.00 Clothing, household expenses $100.00 Credit cards and other loan payments: $465.00 (3 credit cards 3.99%, 12.99% and 0%) Other expenses: $39.99  Overall, I feel I am great investment, with a simple request.

The loan will go towards the upfront capital costs of furniture, appliances, and renovation to create a wonderful caring home for the future residents.  The loan will also help with the first few monthly payments until we have all 4 patients.  Revenue for this start-up will be split among 2 sources: patient's social security payments and patient's out of pocket payments (sometimes paid for by the patient's family members).  Based on conservative financial projections, it is estimated that positive cash flow will occur starting in month 7 and the overall break-even will occur at about month 15.  We are also investing in cost-saving initiatives (efficient showerheads, washer, dryer, light bulbs, etc.) to maximize cash flow.  We hope that you will help us fund this very promising venture.

My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",3388

The legal job market has been particularly difficult to break into (even the Harvard, Yale and Stanford kids are having trouble), but after nearly a year of searching, I have landed firmly in a fantastic position with seemingly endless room for growth, and a more-than-decent starting salary.  I have paid off about $5k toward my debt in the past 4 months, however a large percentage of that money went toward interest.  My average APR is somewhere near 26 percent, though I have not missed a payment in more than four years.  I am wholeheartedly committed to paying down this debt in full within the coming 36 months.  After that, I hope to become an investing member of LendingClub.  If you have any questions or would like further details, please ask!  Thank you for having faith in me.<br/> Borrower added on 05/04/10 > In an attempt to make this process as easy as possible, I have read through many current loan applications that are undergoing funding.  I've found that lenders often would like to know the names, balances, and APRs of cards that borrowers intend to pay down/pay off with the loan funds received from LendingClub.  To that end, I have placed that information below.<br/><br/>LENDER    BAL     APR      MIN PYMT   Time to Pay off@ MIN PYMT<br/>Discover $4,425 @29.99 -  minimum $134 - 18 years <br/>Chase    $5,725  @20.24 - minimum $154    28 years<br/>GM Card $10,727 @ 22.90 - minimum $311  29 years<br/>MBNA (BoA) $4,918 @26.24 minimum $153   25 years<br/><br/>The total of my minimum payments on these cards is currently $752.  I *always* pay at least this much, but sometimes more.  For example, I paid an extra $2000 toward the above-referenced Discover card in February.  In response, Discover (understandably) accepted the money and reduced my credit line by $2k.  <br/><br/>The new payment on the loan I am seeking from LendingClub would be under $900 per month.  In just THREE years, I will have paid off 95 percent of the four loans found above.  This will be accomplished simply by paying $150 per month above my current minimums!  3 Years through LendingClub vs. 20+ years through the credit card companies is a ""no-brainer"" for me.  <br/><br/>One last thing I would like to mention.  I have noticed that LendingClub members often worry that a prospective borrower will pay off the loan ahead of schedule.  At this time, it is my intention to take the full 36 month term to pay off the loan I am seeking.  If I receive substantial raises over the next two years, I might then decide to accelerate repayment.  Full Disclosure =)  Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 05/05/10 > Edited to add:  My loan payment--if granted--from LendingClub will actually only be $832/month.  This is just $80 more than my current monthly minimums as described above.  I had previously stated I would be paying $150 per month above my current monthly minimums, so this makes the LendingClub loan option even more advantageous!<br/> Borrower added on 05/07/10 > I have just submitted my pay stub and employment verification information to LendingClub Home Office.

The funds will be an extension to the bridge of capital on-hand to assist in expanding our business and making necessary purchases and upgrades that will not only improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal operations, but also greatly enhance the customers' overall shopping experience. We will use the funds for the following: A cash register with robust storage and automation capabilities; more shelving for the larger storage room; a larger company sign, advertisement in adjacent communities, small customer and employee incentives, inventory scanners, aesthetic details and upgrades that appeal to the senses of our customers, a larger retail space. What makes me a good borrower is my history with the Lending Club as well as my credit score. We obtained some funding when we opened the doors to our company last year. In just a short amount of time we were able to pay that loan off in full. I am in the U.S. Army so my income is more than stable. I earn a comfortable salary, and I have a little more than 10 years until I retire. My business partner and I are not fans of debt. We barely have any. I have a cell phone bill, and car insurance payments. I receive a housing stipend so my rent, food, and utilities are paid by the military. My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>",2304

Instead, four days later, I received an email from LC stating that the loan had been denied due to incomplete paperwork. I was shocked so I contacted them and fortunately got in touch with the person who denied my loan. I asked him that how come they didn't contact me when they were unable to obtain completed paperwork from me even after I had sent them everything via emails (I have the records to prove it). Their response was that the matter will be investigated and I would be contacted within 24 hours. A few days ago, I received another email requesting the paperwork. This time I sent PDF files and also faxed the documents. I spoke to them last night and they said that I needed to re-list the loan.  They confirmed that for the re-listed loan, they have already verified all information including employment, salary, and federal tax returns and if the loan is funded again, things would go smoothly.

I have a research program that is actively funded by the National Institutes of Health.  What is important about these two points is that I have job stability and a steady, strong source of income.  I am never late on bills, which include student loans, a mortgage, car payment, and credit cards and personal loans.  I am looking to actively pay down debt over the next several years, starting with two accounts.  One is a credit card through Chase that was through Washington Mutual.  When the card transferred to Chase, the interest rate climbed from 10% to 29.99%.  Again, while I have never been late on a payment and continue to make the monthly minimum, I will be unable to pay down the debt (which now stands at just under $3,000) as quickly as I would like and desire a lower rate, something they cannot give to me for 12 months.   Also, a promotional purchase (centrail air installation and furnace work) on a Home Depot card is about to expire, and with it about a $1,000 of interest will be added to the principal amount (now just under $4000) of the loan.  This, combined with the high interest rate (26.99%, which also increased earlier this summer), will make it difficult for me to pay down the debt.  These two accounts are the two primary roadblocks to my plan to decrease my non-mortgage and student loan-related debts.    While my salary provides me with a reasonable debt-to-income ratio, it might sound strange that I underestimated the financial impact of my son following his birth in March of last year.  He began daycare last November, and the $200 weekly daycare payment has made disposable income at a premium, and my desire to make well more than the monthly minimums difficult.

I've worked my whole life to look good on a piece of a paper, that's what my mother taught me. I pay all of my bills every month before the due date and nothing is going to change that about me because looking good on a piece of paper is the only thing that matters to lenders now-a-days. When I say look good on a piece of paper I mean credit score, number of debts, etc.   So I told all of you what I would be using the money for and why I would be a good candidate for the loan. Now I want you to understand my complete situation. I am planning to have my wedding in 2010 and with this economy everything seems to get a little tougher over time. I've done all the math with regards to monthly payments for the loans and I have more than enough for that and all of my other bills and responsibilities.

My wife and I have obtained detailed cost estimates for the project, which sum to $28,300.  At this time, we have $18,000 saved for the project, and a loan of $12,000 from the Lending Club would provide us with the difference (plus a margin of additional funds for the unexpected).  We bought our house at the end of 2005, which was just about at the peak of housing prices in our area.  We put 20% down on our house at purchase, and have a fixed rate mortgage at 6%.  Although cursory appraisals do not indicate that we are ’‘Î¢’Ç’_’Ç’upside down’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎ with our mortgage, we have not had any success securing a traditional home equity loan though either our local credit union or a large national bank.  It appears that our situation is typical for these strange economic times: we have strong credit scores, a reasonable financing goal and steady income, but limited options for borrowing for remodeling.  Hence, we decided to turn to the Lending Club to finance this project.   My wife and I have two kids, ages 5 and 7, and we expect that our current house will be our ’‘Î¢’Ç’_’Ç’forever house’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎ.  We do not view our home as a short- or medium-term investment; it is simply where we want to live.  That stated, our kitchen is the weakest part of our house, and so we expect a relatively high return on this remodeling project.  Should something terrible happen and we are forced to sell our house, Lending Club lenders would share a proportionally small fraction of this risk, since our own funds will support well over half of the cost of the remodeling project.  My income is very reliable: I have a Ph.D. and a tenure-track position at a major research institution.  I have held this position for nearly six years.  My annual reviews have been very positive, and I have every indication that I will spend my career here.  In addition, over the last year I have had success with private consulting, which is the source for much of our savings.    I have been married for 11 years.  My wife is a painter, and is doing quite well on the local art scene.  Naturally, she has a day job, which is in the area of  non-profit administration. She has worked on and off in this area for over ten years, and she has held her current position for over four years.  It is a part-time situation that supports our finances but leaves her afternoons free to spend time in the studio before the kids get home from school.     As my credit report shows, we have consistently managed our finances responsibly.  The one blemish on my report is from a mortgage payment I missed a few years ago: I failed to update our automatic bill payment after our mortgage rate was adjusted (former mortgage, again our current mortgage is fixed).  If I recall correctly I underpaid by $26, but the lender was unsympathetic and reported it despite my pleadings.  Our current mortgage payment is approximately 20% of our gross income, and we pay on time, always.  We quit using credit cards about two years ago.  I have two modest car payments: $200 and $270.  The latter is for a car I bought my mother, who has been on disability since I was a teen and needs our help.   The estimated payment for the loan we are seeking will be in the vicinity of $375/month.  This is about what we paid in preschool tuition for my 5-year-old last year.  But he is going to kindergarten, and we will soon be relieved of this expenditure.  So, in effect, our monthly finances will change little when we take on this remodeling loan, and we know that we will be comfortable with this payment.  Taking the new payment into account, our monthly household debt-to-income ratio (not including mortgage) will be about 12%.",3734

Until now I have been living comfortably on my salary. I drive a Chevy Malibu that is fully paid off. I bought it used even though I could afford to buy a newer or bigger car.<br/><br/>Recently I saw a business opportunity in buying and sell some antiques. Because those antiques are quite undervalued in here but are highly demanded in somewhere else, I think the risk is small and the reward can be tremendous. I have spent more than $45000 on that already. I can show the invoices if required. It&rsquo;ll take me some time to sell the antiques I have bought at the best price I can get.

I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.  Thank you for reading my story, and thank you for helping.<br/>",2392

Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location Š—ç’_’ê walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan Š—ç’_’ê I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value Š—ç’_’ê I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.  Thanks for your consideration!",3642

I have been with my current company (full time) since March 2001. My wife is also employed at a local dog boarding kennel since March 2008 as the manager. Her experience in animal care began in 1996, at a local veterinary hospital where she spent the next 9 years. Her exit from this location was amicable one, as she was offered to help another doctor open his 2 new practices. This took approximately 2 years, from there she was offered yet another venture of opening the kennel of a National pet store chain. After several years of working overtime for others in order to run their business's, we decided that she could have been working this hard to open her very own place. We are grateful for all the experience she has had in the blood, sweat and tears of opening a new business but we are ready to sweat for ourselves. I have no plans to leave my current full time job anytime in the near future, and my wife will be working at her current job, up until it is no longer humanly possible after opening our own location. This was not decided quickly or lightly, especially in these economic times. Thankfully, we remain employed and are able to pay our bills and mortgage on time. We've spent the past 8 months reading, researching and questioning other business owners in our area and have received excellent advice and feedback on our &quot;dream&quot; and we are ready to put her experience in the pet care industry to use.

My family and I are looking to make a move and purchase a new home in this perfect buyers market. This loan would certainly guarantee that I become a 1st time home buyer this year.<br/> Borrower added on 08/24/10 > I believe that lenders should commit their funds to my loan because I am a low risk borrower. Being a tenured teacher I have a steady and safe job with a good salary.                <br/> <br/>I intend to pay the loan off in 2-3 years, possibly sooner. Luckily in CA as a 1st time home buyer I still have an opportunity to apply for the $10,000 tax credit that they extended until the end of this year. My intentions are to use the majority of the tax credit to pay off my loan. I do understand that there is a possibility that for some reason I may not receive the tax credit in full and that is why I mentioned 2-3 years to pay it off. I have a good credit score and good rapport with all of my creditors. I always pay within my terms and more often then not pay my balances off prior to the due dates. For example I just recently paid off my car approx 6 months ahead of schedule.<br/> Borrower added on 08/25/10 > My fiance and I have been pre-approved for a home mortgage loan of up to 325k, but given that this is our 1st home we are shopping in the market of 225k and below which would keep us well under our budget and not be overwhelming. I am the co-borrower on the mortgage loan and my fiance is the primary borrower. Even with this newly aquired debt of the personal loan our income to debt ratio will not be drastically affected. Our current combined annual income exceeds 100k and our debt to income ratio w/o our current rent and with this new loan payment is at approx 16%. Our debt to income ratio with our current rent payment of $950.00 and this new loan payment is approx 24%. The ideal debt to income ratio that mortgage lenders and investors would like to see is at 36% and we are well below that with our combined income and debts. This loan combined with some of our savings would help cover our 3.5% down payment on our 30 Year Fixed FHA loan as well as the closing and moving cost. I hope that this answers all of your questions and helps you instill the confidence in us to contribute to our loan. Again thanks for the consideration and should you have any additional questions please feel free to ask. Thanks in advance!<br/>",2470

I recently purchased a new personal residence that I used most of my free cash to acquire.  I came across a great real estate deal that I want to complete.  In the past, hard money lenders would simply lend on investment properties based on the loan to value but now the hard money lenders want you to put up a down payment as well.  That brings me to Lending Club.  The terms through Lending Club allow me to still meet my investment parameters so I figured I would give it a try.  The loan will be used as the downpayment for an investment property that I am going to repair and resell.  The property is in the Petworth area of Washington, DC.  The purchase price is $160,000 and the repairs are estimated at $55,000 with a $5,000 contingency ($60,000 total repair estimate) for a total of $220,000 (62% of value) to acquire and fix up the property.  The after repair value of the property is $355,000 which is conversative.  My hard money lender looked at the deal and immediately said it was solid.  The hard money is lined up but the lender requires that I have some ""skin in the game"" in this environment so he wants me to put down $20,000 as a downpayment.

I am looking to consolidate it all to improve my credit score to qualify for a business loan.  A good business loan requires a credit score of at least 720.  I am almost there.  I have a steady job and business that can give plenty of positive return.  I expect to pay off the LendingClub loan not in 3 years but in 6 months once I close 1 or 2 deals in my business or get that business loan.  My business involves real estate.  I will be purchasing distressed or bank owned properties and then reselling.  I already have a serious list of cash buyers and conventional financed buyers to resell to.  I have access to hard money lenders that will only lend to purchase property at wholesale price and resell at retail price where the difference is our profit.  If you want more details feel free to contact me.  The loan I am requesting right now is only a debt consolidation loan to improve my credit score and lower payments.  I have had no problem making payments just a problem getting a sufficient loan for my business or debt consolidation from a regular bank.  They are obviously not lending and want higher scores than what I have.  Thanks and hope to do business with you.  <br/><br/>,1291

They can't seem to understand that I don't pay for the mortgage.  I own an LLC that my rental business is operated under, I work 6 days a week at a bank call center.

I learned VERY quickly from this and have maintained exemplary credit ever since.

Since we never wanted our bills to be late, we paid the minimum and had to charge groceries, gas, etc. to the cards.  It took about 8 months for me to finally find a new job.  Once I started working again and when my wife graduated from school, we started seeing a dent in the debt we accumulated...until the credit card/financial crisis happened.  We then saw our rates get ridiculously high, and in the process of this, we found out we were pregnant.  With this loan, you are helping us save thousands of dollars in interest that would be going to the credit card companies... we will always make the loan on time, and since my wife is completing her CPA before next summer, we anticipate paying off the loan in 3 to 4 years instead of 5.

Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions.

I have already saved $5,000 in an attempt to meet the SBA requirements of 20% collateral of the SBA. However, not many banks are willing to lend to a business where the main source of revenue is the sale of tobacco, even more a startup.  We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.  Our goal is to soft-open on August 28th with a grand-opening on September 19th, 2009.  Please send any and all questions, I will be more than happy to ellaborate",2235

I greatly appreciate your assistance in getting this funded.  I am a 28 y/o professional that helps Drs. at a world Famous hospital in Minnesota get funding for research to help patients.  I love having the opportunity to make the lives of cancer patients better, and help develop new techniques for radiation oncology.  It is incredibly stressful, but also reqarding.  <br/>Life hit a speed bump when I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety earlier this year, and then got worse when my wife decided that she was going to divorce me.  Because of the divorce my wife has kind of taken control, and I pretty much only see my adorable 15 month old daughter every other Saturday.  (I'm tearing up just thinking about it.)  My plan with this money is to assist me with divorce attorney fees because my family has never had money like her family has.  I also want to purchase a cruiser motorcycle that I can use for the occasional trips to visit my daughter where my soon to be ex leaves the house and I spend time with my little girl there.  I think this will really save on gas money.  Also, I just think that riding on the open road (helmet for me of course), would be a great stress reliever.  I really just need to feel less stress..., feel happy, and feel normal again.<br/><br/>Thank you for all of you that look at this and help.  I could really use this for so many reasons right now.  I hope it will happen.  <br/><br/>Thank you all in advance.  You have no idea how much it means to me.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Seth B.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank everyone so much.  If  I am fortunate enough to obtain this loan, it will be used for a bike.  It will also be used to pay off some higher interest credit cards, and medical bills that I was left with as the result of a recent divorce.  Thank you all so much in advance.  I hope this is able to come through soon.<br/><br/>Best Regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank you all so much.  I am just finishing going through a divorce, and this will help with medical bills I was left with so that they can be paid and the hospital won't try to be collecting from me.  Also, I was left with a higher interest card with a balance and this would help take care of that.  Also, I have been through a great deal since before last November (depression, illness, injury, divorce...and now I am only currently able to see my 15 month old daughter every other Saturday, and that's usually not even spending the night...) I have always wanted a bike (non-sports/rocket) in order to get some open air (helmet of course), and just try to be a little bit happier since it has been so long since I have.  I appreciate all of your help.  Thank you, and best regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/21/10 > Thank you everyone that has helped so far.  I really appreciate it.  I just wanted to let it be known that I will have additional medical expenses for myself that would also need to be covered by this.

I believe it would be higher if I had a longer credit history. I am financially responsible, hold a steady income, and own my home. In the last seven months of employment since graduation, I have paid off over $6000 in student loan and credit card debt. <br/><br/>About the Loan:<br/><br/>I have been paying Sallie Mae faithfully every month for two years now and only $700 has come off the principal on my student loan of $5000. They estimate that I have another 7 years left to pay it off at their 11.8% interest rate. I would much rather have it paid off in 3 years, while paying off my credit cards as well. <br/><br/>I have four credit cards, two of which are fully paid off. They have a total limit of over $30,000. I have $6500 charged to two of them leftover from when I was in college. Both have the same high interest rates they had when I got them during school (one is around 15% and the other is about 18%).<br/><br/>With this loan, I intend to pay off the Sallie Mae remainder ($4300) and these cards ($6500) in one convenient monthly payment. Any money left over after fees will go into my savings account for emergencies.<br/> Borrower added on 11/15/10 > My Employment:<br/><br/>I am securely employed in a 2.5 year contract.

For reference, everything was fine the previous year, a rare feat for a 22 year old car, but this year it seems to have simply lost the will to live. They were relatively small things to fix on their own, but the total cost to repair everything myself would have been significantly higher than the actual value of the car- not that the idea of doing it all anyway didn't cross my mind. However, I've ultimately decided it is time to move on.<br/><br/>I am currently shopping for a relatively cheap and, most of all, reliable car that I hope to drive for just as long. It will probably be a 90's Mazda or Toyota. The reason I turned to LendingClub is simple, I could not find a single bank that would be willing to provide an auto loan on a vehicle older than ~7 years. I would love a 'new-new' car, or even something slightly used, but I know that is way beyond my means.<br/><br/>Speaking of my means, I would consider myself very responsible financially.

I have been paying out about 3000+ each month just for debt, rent and bills for the past two years.

Therefore, I just want to slash my monthly spending on paying off debts and could have extra money left for family saving.  I believe warm-hearted people are always around.

I am seeking a debt consolidation because my mom ran up the American Express bill (we are both on the account) and they require the account to be paid in full each month.  The balance slowly increased and I wasn't paying attention until it grew to what it is now.  Despite my income, I cannot make the lump sum payment they want.  I could easily pay it off on an installment basis, but they will not transfer the balance to an installment basis, and I cannot pay it off in one month.  The American Express is now cancelled, and my mom is no longer a signatory on any of my credit accounts.  However, I want to pay it off as quickly as possible so it does not affect my credit.

During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again. My financial situation: I have two major RACING clients one of them called me the day of my 3rd surgery, which happen to be the day before Thanksgiving. This client I have a contract for around 13K with a balance of 8K left on that contract over the next few years. I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also. The main reason as you can tell I am a trooper and never say never to a challenge. My gross income has risen 15K in 2007. I have steady monthly clients good for at least $3000. I just need that extra financial cushion to help the lives of other persons who are disabled.

I spent the winter restoring the interior and all it needs now is this engine rebuild.   Having the engine overhauled boosts the airplanes value from it's current $20k market value to around $30-$32k and makes it more fuel efficient and reliable.  Once the airplane is flying again, I plan of flying it for various charitable missions, including Angel Flight, Young Eagles and Pilots n Paws (animal rescue). Flying is my passion and I like to apply this passion in a way that I can help others!  I recently relocated back to MA, am college degreed with 20+ years career experience. I recently accepted a new job in the medical device industry, and have a decent income ($90k/year) going forward, but living expenses while out of work, plus necessary move costs incurred to get myself here have depleted my current cash reserves.  Based on my new job income ($7500/mo) , I will be in a position to pay off my current credit cards and service this loan without any difficulty, in fact, if they provided shorter terms, I'd gladly pay off in  just 4 months. but am OK with carrying this loan out to it's 36 month (3 year) term. Longer term, I am looking to eventually buy real estate (condo or starter house)    Time is of the essence! The engine rebuilders in PA already have the airplane engine in their shop now and I need these funds to get the 4 week remanufacturing cycle started. They need $6k down and the balance upon delivery. I will have the funds (through future pay checks) to cover the aircraft mechanics fees to reinstall engine when it's done.     I really appreciate your consideration as a potential lender!",1767

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are ""above and beyond"" the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such ""above and beyond"" circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).  My own credit rating is reputable enough, as you can see, and I've never made a late payment. As an investor in this business, you can expect the same reliability in the returns you'll be provided with, given your interest and participation in this loan. Thank you greatly for your time, and I look forward to working with you indirectly as a partner in this project.",2966

Fewer payments, fewer payment dates and a lower interest rate means an easier repayment process for me to juggle and pay down more quickly.  I had excellent credit until the banks all decided to randomly reduce lines of unsecured credit simultaneously increasing the percentage of my credit in use and decreasing my credit score.  I didnt realize how vulnerable I was until then.  My goal now is an absolute zero amount of outstanding unsecured debt.  With this loan and other aggressive spending cuts I expect to have all my credit cards paid off in less than 3 years.

I teach music at my wife's school for autism, Celebrate the Children and also work as a recording engineer. I have a steady income. We recently adopted siblings from Kazakhstan (brother and sister). I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000. I have been turned down by my bank and we spent most of our savings on our adoption process. I am experiencing quite a bit of pain and have scheduled the procedure for July- hoping I can raise the money.",1343

I am also a Lending Club lender and as such, will try to answer the questions I see asked most often in listings. However, if I have miss anything, ask away and I'll do my best to answer.<br/><br/>Employment<br/>==========<br/>I am a software engineer for a privately funded startup company. The company has been in existence for right at 2 years and I have been with them for 1.5. We integrate biometric solutions with banking software. Our investor is founder and chairman of one of the most widely used core banking systems in the world, which gives us a unique advantage as a startup. I will be traveling to Africa in October to install our second client. We also have 5 more signed contracts awaiting installation over the next 2 years.<br/><br/>Home Equity<br/>===========<br/>I refinanced my house earlier this year in order to convert it from a 7/1 ARM to a fixed 30-year and reduce the rate. The appraisal came in at $220,000.00 during the refinance while Zillow estimates the property at $213,000.00. I currently owe $175,000.00 on the house and there is no second mortgage or HELOC associated with the house, only the first mortgage. When refinancing, I made a large payment at closing in order to reduce the amount owed to just under 80%, thus avoiding PMI. However, this payment wiped out most of the savings that would have been used to finance the wedding.<br/><br/>Debts<br/>=====<br/>I do have two credit cards whose balances have risen recently due to some of the initial wedding expenses. They are both American Express cards. One is at $3400 while the other is at $2500. The rates on these two cards are both at 13.24%. The first $5900 from this loan will go directly to paying off these two cards.<br/><br/>Budgeting<br/>=========<br/>I follow a 60 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 budgeting scheme and use Mint to manage my finances. 10% to retirement, 10% to long term savings, 10% to short term savings, 10% to fun, and the rest, 60%, to cost of living (mortgage, lending club loan payment, bills, clothes, gas, etc.). Each of the first three 10% amounts are auto-drafted on pay day. This leaves my budget roughly as outlined below:<br/><br/>$4820 : Net Monthly Income<br/>-------------- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 --------------<br/>$500 : Retirement<br/>$500 : Long Term Savings<br/>$500 : Short Term Savings<br/>$500 : Fun<br/>---------------------- 60 ---------------------<br/>$1250 : Mortgage<br/>$130 : Mobile Phone (Family Plan)<br/>$100 : Power (average over last 3 bills)<br/>$30 : Gas (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$22 : Garbage (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$36 : Lawn<br/>$16 : Water (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$400 : Groceries (rounded average over last 3 months)<br/>=====================================================<br/>$836<br/><br/>The 60% can obviously fluctuate, but with the savings already factored in, there should be plenty of wiggle room. In addition, I have not adjusted my tax withdrawals, which left me with a more than $3000 return this past year.

Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/10 > Lending Club, <br/>As I wait for my listing to post this evening, I thought it would be prudent to proactively answer some common questions you may have prior to deciding to fund this note.  This is obviously an investment on your end and I want to make you as comfortable as possible regarding the following items:  my compensation structure/job security, current debt obligations, monthly expenses/budget, and my regimented plan to become completely debt-free.  As I mentioned in my initial description, I plan to be in your shoes once this loan is paid back in full.<br/>&bull;	What is AmWINS Group Inc.? What is your job title and what are your duties? <br/>I work for the largest property and casualty wholesale brokerage firm in the U.S.  I have been with them for a total of 5 years (including an internship while in college) and really enjoy my job.  <br/>My current title is Producer (Broker) and I specialize in the Healthcare Industry.  I facilitate/negotiate the essential property and casualty insurance products that hospitals must purchase in order to protect themselves so they can provide us care when we need it. My career is going very well and I certainly have no intention of going anywhere.  To be honest, I&rsquo;d like to retire from here years down the road!<br/>My compensation structure is salary-based with potential for an annual bonus.  I have provided my monthly income (based on salary only) and will try to figure out how to verify that with LC today to increase your comfort level. <br/>&bull;	What debt obligations do you currently have (please provide balances, interest rates) and which debts do you intend to pay off with this loan? <br/>Mastercard - $7,000 @ 16.99%<br/>Visa - $3,000 @ 9.99%<br/>I will pay off each of these amounts in full upon this note being fully funded.  <br/>&bull;	Can you list your monthly itemized expenses and their amounts? <br/>Rent - $600 per month<br/>Car Payment - $206 per month<br/>The only other monthly expenses are utilities, groceries, gas, etc.<br/>&bull;	Monthly Budget <br/>Gross Income = $5,000 <br/>Net Income = $3,400 (after taxes, benefits costs, etc.)<br/>&bull;	My Plan (with your help!)<br/>Once I receive the $10k loan from my investor(s), I will eliminate the debt I currently have the high interest rate.  While my recent salary increase has certainly assisted me in working towards eliminating debt and building a foundation for my future, I just can&rsquo;t justify continuing to pay the interest rates associated with each CC.  My credit score and history have allowed me to work with each of you at a rate that would be unintelligent to pass up.  <br/>The monthly payment was calculated at $306.67 per month, but I will be putting $500 towards the loan amount each month.  I know this will cut the loan term a bit short and that will affect your total money earned, but you will be making a financially-sound decision.  On another note, you would really be helping me become established and allow me to look forward to the exciting next steps in my life (engagement ring, home purchase, etc.).

We currently hold one residential rental property there (zip=46229) through Michelle Ryan Investments, LLC (my husband's LLC, a WA and IN registered LLC).  Though we live away from Indiana, we have our own team set up locally in Indianapolis, consisting of a general contractor, a construction mgmt company, a realtor, a home inspector, and a property management company.  We coordinated all aspects of the renovation of the first rental property from right here WA.  The renovation was a big success and ended before the scheduled end date, thanks to the very talented team.  Upon securing our second rental property, we will be using the same team to renovate it, lease it out, and collect rents.  Monthly rents from the 2nd rental property will be covering our monthly payments to you (Lendingclub lenders).  It would take a month or two before the property becomes move-in ready and gets rented out.  This will most likely result in a situation where we have to pay you before we collect any rent from our tenant.  So, what do we do if we have to pay you before collecting the first rent???  How do we make sure we meet our Lendingclub obligation???  No problem at all.  We own our existing rental house, free and clear.  Because of that, net cash flow from it is more than enough to cover our monthly Lendingclub payment, in case we have to use that source.  As many families lost their precious homes to foreclosure, they are desperately searching for a house to rent.  This has increased the demand for rental houses.  We would like to help a family get a house.  To summarize, you as a Lendingclub lender have a very low risk and have a return that's unbelievably higher than that of banks.  So, please help us help you, everyone!  Please help us help a family that needs our help.  Let's find ourselves in a win-win-win situation!  Thank you for your interest in becoming our lender.",2002

I'm more than happy to answer any questions about me or my intended use for this loan.<br/> Borrower added on 02/26/10 > I've read through some other available loans and noticed some common<br/>questions that lenders ask. To be proactive I've put together some details<br/>providing my answers to those questions.<br/><br/>I. Background Information<br/><br/>I graduated from college in 12-2006<br/>with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics/Computers. I have also taken<br/>actuarial exams in order to be further my career as an actuary. During<br/>college I ended up getting married and having a son. Going to school<br/>fulltime, and taking care of my family resulted in my accumulation of credit<br/>card debt. While my debt was building the interest rates were in the mid<br/>single digit range, so I wasn't careful enough with the use of the credit<br/>cards. Even as late as last February my rates were so low that instead of<br/>paying off my debt, I used the money I had saved for a down payment on my<br/>house. I've also used savings to pay off student loans instead of my credit<br/>cards. Now that my credit card companies have severely increased my rates,<br/>the balance grows more and more each month. I've never missed or been late<br/>with payments on any bills. I have a lot of recent inquiries on my credit<br/>report because I have recently purchased a used car and compared quotes from<br/>many different companies. Also, for the past month I have been actively<br/>searching for ways to consolidate my credit card debt.<br/><br/>II. Employment Information<br/><br/>I work for Producers Incorporated located in Central Florida. I'm an actuarial<br/>analyst and help manage the sales, administration, and customer service<br/>departments for the company. The company has 35-40 employees and I work<br/>directly with the owner overseeing all areas of the business. The company<br/>sells various insurances and investments. I have been working there since<br/>01-2007 when I graduated from college. <br/><br/>III.

Loan Goal<br/><br/>My goal with this loan is to pay off the 3 credit cards with the highest<br/>interest rates. I'm hoping to pay off the cards so I can<br/>start cancelling them and reign in my revolving credit lines. By<br/>consolidating my debt with this loan, I'll be able to pay off close to<br/>$16,000 in debt over 3 years, by only increasing my monthly payment by $142.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time and consideration, I'll do whatever I can to promptly<br/>answer any questions you may have.<br/>",3436

I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, IŠ—ç’_Îéve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The Š—ç’_’one manŠ—ç’_Î shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, Š—ç’_’all you can eatŠ—ç’_Î support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. ItŠ—ç’_Îés also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a companyŠ—ç’_Îés IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etcŠ—ç’__) A typical Š—ç’_’computerŠ—ç’_Î company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business IŠ—ç’_Îéve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. ItŠ—ç’_Îés a tool to help get the next level.  3.	Personal Growth: I have had to change my personal mentality from being a computer tech to an entrepreneur who manages a growing company.  I appreciate your time and please feel free to contact me for questions.  Thanks for your consideration.",3668

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>",3030

I recently took a job with a pay cut because I feel it is a good move for the future.   It will take me forever to pay back my credit card bills with the interest rates I am currently paying and that gives me very little room to save money.  I have a full time job and occasionally work a part time job as well.  I am responsible and am completely open to having this money taken directly from my bank account each month.  It can be set up to take from my account on one of the days where I get paid in case anyone is skeptical that I won't have it in my account.   Thanks for your help!,824

I had been living for the past 2+ years with a roommate and I had paid the full security deposit of $3,000.  With the OK of my landlord, I vacated and my roommate decided to remain at the house on a month-to-month basis.  My name has been taken off of the lease.  The landlord has retained the security deposit since one roommate remained and advise me to settle the security deposit issue with the remaining roommate.  My former-roommate promised to fully reimburse me for the security deposit by mid-June but has failed to do so.  Now my former roommate has advised me that she will be giving notice to vacate by the end of July and will tell the landlord that the security deposit should be returned to me.   In the mean time, I have paid to get into my new place and had been expecting to have the use of my security deposit funds.  My loan request is to cover this money that I previously though I would have the use of but now will likely have to wait until mid-August to actually recieve.

When we tried to pay them off, the credit card companies lowered our limits--which then lowered my score again.  I had always been in the 720 range prior to these events.

The debt is from credit cards that I used while in college which have all seen increases in the interest rates to very high levels.  In the past I had not worried so much about the card interest or making lump payoffs in order to keep my primary checking in good order.  The card companies have made the obvious mistake jacking up my interest (IMO)... I hope to pay investors of this loan a ""fair"" amount of interest instead and leave them with none.  I am currently paying around $500/month to the various cards to avoid paying a ton of interest.  About $3000 will take care of this debt.  A consequence of paying on debt is that I've only saved about $1000 in the past 8 months.  Therefore the other portion of this money will be going towards moving forward in a relationship (engagement).  I feel I am a good candidate for this loan.  I do have school and auto debt but it is very manageable.  I also hold a good paying job as an engineer in a very stable industry.

The fourteen months since that wonderful weekend have been, if nothing else, an adventure.

So, sitting down for the past few months and seeing a big stack of credit card bills gives me a stomach ache and I don't want to ever see that pile again.  <br/><br/>As I said above, I'll be paying off seven credit cards ranging from $4,000, 3,546, $1,117...1,548...1,625...$1,265...2,100.  So with the consolidation loan I'd be able to not rely on credit to get by each month.  <br/><br/>I hope this enough information for everyone who is evaluating this request.  Please contact me if you need more from me?<br/> Borrower added on 10/18/11 > I can't seem to find the edit option for my statement.  I made a mistake of saying nine credit cards in one part of my statement and at the end I said seven.  The correct number is seven.<br/>",1308

I am a good candidate for this loan because I have over come some really major hurtles in the past 8 years; divorce & relocation to another state by myself and have been able to stay afloat (meeting all financial commitments).  Unfortunately, my Š—ç’_’DŠ—ç’_Î credit rating is a result of difficulties  during those years of  the divorce & relocation.  I have made steady fiscal progress with each passing year.  My last big hurtle to reaching my goal of financial freedom is eliminating lingering bad debt.  No longer do I utilize credit cards to live!  When I moved to my current state of residence I accepted a state government job for $9.00/hr and no benefits in hopes of Š—ç’_’àmaking something happenŠ—ç’_Îé with my life.  Within two months I had a position on the regular payroll with benefits and have progressed from that entry level position into a management position.  I am now one of the Š—ç’_’àgo to galsŠ—ç’_Îé for others in my professional community because of my integrity and experience in our field.  Presently I am paying a mortgage and assisting my husband with our mutual debt and repayment of  my old closed accounts which we took out a loan for 2 years ago. This loan is scheduled to be paid off by April 2009. Each month we sit down and pay the bills and we see no progress, other than just keeping current.  We would like to be able to one day help others in need and to do that we need to clear this debt up.  By combining these payments into one, perhaps a bit lower and certainly a lower interest rate, payment we could realize this dream.  I am hoping that someone out there is willing to provide me with the opportunity to continue to realize success and achieve future dreams and to continue the Lending Club cycle of helping others.

We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.

I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.

Five years doesn’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎét sound very creditable.<br/> <br/>Good Borrower:  For years I had a credit rating of over 820-840s, and want it back.

After taking a personal finance course my first goal is to pay down bad debt by consolidating. My interest in this loan is consistent with lowering my current interest being paid on the unsecured debt. Following acceptance of this loan I plan to cancel credit cards and start investments into an emergency fund. The additional $3,940 funds not existing within my revolving credit is my wife's unsecured debt. My wife is currently six months from completing her two year degree in Radiology which will increase our joint yearly income. The one delinquency mentioned was for a student loan that was setup to deliver all notifications online via the bank web site when logged into the account. As the lender did not know I was still in school and I was not regularly checking the online message center the account went 60 days without payment. Upon the first phone call from the lender I promptly paid the delinquent amount and completed necessary paperwork for the in-school deferment. As this was a mistake on my behalf, it was well learned to not let any of my revolving credit balances go un-noticed again.<br/>",1228

We have absolutely no problem paying our bills, we are just looking to lower our rates for the remainder of our debt repayment... which you can track at http://www.DebtFreeAdventure.com.

Another reason why we have come to Lending Club is because we just had all 3 of our remaining credit card companies raise our rates... it was the last straw!

I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>",2683

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash.

Here is some information that may be helpful to you in making your decision.<br/>I will be using this loan to consolidate three credit cards.<br/>I have never missed or made a late payment on these credit cards or on any other debt.<br/>I discovered Lending Club and found that the rates available here are less than what I am paying on my credit cards.<br/>As I indicated above I have never missed a payment, and the monthly payment for this loan is roughly half what I am paying now.  <br/>I will be repaying this loan well in advance of the 5 year term.<br/>My payment history on all debts is flawless.  However, I am told that my credit score has suffered as a result of the following:<br/>&bull;My debt to income ratio is too high.  A couple things you may want to know about this.  <br/>     oMy monthly income is $9200 and I have been with my employer for over 10 years.  My wife&rsquo;s monthly income is $3900.  Combined monthly income is $13,100.  As you can see making this payment is well within our means.<br/>     oThis loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.<br/>     oThere are two homes on my credit report.  One of them is a vacation home that I rent out.<br/>     oWe have a family member that lives with us who also contributes towards paying bills.<br/><br/>&bull;My credit card balances are high in comparison to their credit limits<br/>     oAs you may be aware with the recent bank crisis many banks have started lowering credit limits on existing accounts.  Since my limits have been lowered my balance is now closer to the card limit.<br/>     oBy paying off my credit cards I expect to see my credit score go back up since my total balance will be a smaller percentage of my total available credit.  My point being that I am very interested in improving my credit score so defaulting on this loan is the farthest thing from my mind.<br/><br/>Please feel free to share any thoughts or questions you may have.<br/>Thank you,<br/> Borrower added on 12/19/10 > My original description read &quot;This loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  This should have read &quot;This loan will of course all be used to pay off credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  Sorry for any confusion.<br/><br/>In reviewing the questions Lending Club investors often ask of loan requesters I found the most often is postion within their company.

In Dec 2010 I started working for new company where I gross $5,000 monthly, the biggest salary I've made in my profession.  <br/><br/>My current monthly expenses total $1,500, broken down as:<br/><br/>$900 credit card bills<br/>$340 rent (my share)<br/>$160 car insurance<br/>$100 mobile phone / internet<br/><br/>I am diligent in paying my bills every month and have never missed a payment. <br/><br/>I haven't been a good saver in my lifetime.  But this whole episode with my parents makes me regret not putting anything away.  They came to me for help and at the moment I can't do anything for them.  Since joining my new company I've felt like I make enough money to be able to put a good amount away and not live paycheck-to-paycheck anymore.  And in a few months time, I'd have the cash saved up to give them.  But since action is needed now, I'm here to ask for your help.<br/>",1529

The reason I'm applying for the loan is because I'm moving out of the room I've been living in for the past three years.  I moved into a tiny, tiny room in Westchester County.  It was so small I didn't even have a closet.  These past few years I've learned to use the space to my advantage.  I want to move out now because I'm in a comfortable spot in my life to do so.  I found a place in the Bronx that isn't exactly above my pay grade but one where it would leave me a bit underfunded given my bills.  Between the apartment fees, utilities, medical bills, and other monthly bills I don't feel with the loan I have I'll be able to live decently.  So I need the loan.  I have a very good job at CBS Radio, but I don't make as much as I want.<br/> Borrower added on 04/21/10 > I plan on using the funds for several reasons primarily for moving out.  The initial apartment fees are roughly $4000 dollars which includes the first month, last month, security deposit and broker fee.  After writing out a careful budget of all my essential bills (i.e. rent, electric, phone, transportation, food, medical) I realized I wouldn't be able to live decently.  I needed help.  So I am turning to get some help. <br/>I'm also using the loan to consolidate the remaining amount of my credit cards, which stands at $3700 dollars.  The remaining amount will be added to my account to help pay for my rent and other essential costs.  I want to mention that I am an extremely hardworking guy who constantly monitors his credit score.  I currently hold an average score of 750. I always pay my bills, pay more than the minimum, and keep an eye on what I spend.<br/> Borrower added on 04/26/10 > Living on my own has been a goal of mine for some time now.  I suppose part of the reason was I was tired of sharing bathrooms, listening to loud music at inappropriate times, constantly eating out and living in a room without a closet I think it's time to pack up and move.  Life has this way of telling you when to hold them and fold them and I think it's time to fold and live on my own.  That loan will help me in that regard.<br/>",2228

My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

As an active duty military member, I have been deployed for 8 of the last 10 years, and found it difficult to achieve the financial security I was hoping.  While I do have college savings and a home, I would rather not tap into those secure investments to pay off my credit cards.  Instead, this loan will allow me to pay off my credit card debt within 5 years, and at the same time allow my savings and home to continue to appreciate.  I have never defaulted on a loan, including a home loan, and I have no intention of ever defaulting on my financial obligations. That is exactly why I are hoping to pay off our revolving debt with this loan. The easy answer would be to go to a credit counseling company, but it is my obligation to pay off my debt, which is what I will do with this structured loan.  Just as I serve my country with honor, I also honor my commitments, including my financial commitments.  Thank you for your favorable consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/11 > I would like to add, that my long, positive credit history supports the fact that I honor my financial committments, having never once defaulted on a debt.  This includes my home, which I proudly pay each month.  Although offered a huge mortgage during the mortgage gold rush, I only assumed a loan that was within reason given my income.  As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.  So while I have collateral, I would rather not tap into these secure assets, and instead remain disciplined to pay off my credit card debt in 5 years while my assets continue to appreciate.<br/>Thank you again for the response and the favorable consideration.<br/>",1871

My debt started to jump as soon as I had to move out of my ex's house. Even though my apartment rent isn't that huge, once you start buying groceries and paying bills, you get backed up, especially if you don't have the money to begin with. I have just gotten to a point where I pay so much on many little bills that keeping up is getting impossible. I needed a way to get all my bills into one without screwing up my credit like most consolidation loans do. I have about 11,000 in credit card debt, 5-6,000 in student loans, 3,000 in medical bills, and a 12,000 car loan. 18,000 was the highest I could get so whatever I can pay off will help tremendously. Obviously I need to pay my credit card debt because the interest rates are high, even higher than 16%. After that, I need to put the rest towards my other bills. I feel like such a failure, I am an educated woman with a masters degree and the fact that I could get myself into this much trouble makes me sick.

We consider this a safe loan because even if the business is a complete flop (not likely!) I have an existing income stream from other websites that will more then cover the payments with no hassle. Payments will be automatic and always on time. I am also investing a great deal of my own cash into this project, so I have complete faith in the business.

My brand new wife and I are spending our time getting our financial future set up and combined together.

With her income paying all her portion of the college bills, her car, her credit she has brought to the table, my DTI is 18% and this can be documented if you require details.  My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.

Most of the credit cards have been closed by me. I, of course, am continuing to pay on them monthly on time. i usually pay more than the min amount due on each per month.  Also, I live in a home that is owned by my oldest sidter and DO NOT PAY RENT.  Thank You C. Council",686

It will not be the most elaborate wedding, as we are staying budget conscious, but it will hopefully be a beautiful little event that they will always remember.<br/><br/>I was turned on to LC after being directed here by LendingTree. I applied in two places; a credit union, and LendingTree. I received approval from the credit union, and from both lenders that LendingTree (one being here at LC). I never knew of LC before, and after spending several hours researching exactly what it is, reading reviews, and scouring the fine print of the loan agreements/borrower membership agreement, I can't believe I didn't stumble across this earlier.<br/><br/>I decided to go with a personal loan through LC for two reasons; 1) Although I have the available credit lines on my cards, the lowest interest rate right now is around the 15 to 16 percent range, which is nearly triple the LC rate I qualified for, and 2) The entire idea of giving money back to the hardworking people who deserve it, and are kind enough to lend it to others, is just so much better than giving it to the &quot;big boys&quot; that have left me so disgusted these past few years. I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years.

I can't think of much else to add, but I do appreciate you taking the time to read through this and sincerely hope I can get fully funded so that the interest goes back to the P2P lending network rather than the big boys on wall street.<br/><br/>Thanks again, and best regards!<br/>",2128

I currently have $11,000 of credit card debt.  The rest of the loan would be used towards the wedding for this August.  I know the current terms seems a bit high at a interest rate of 17.88% but it's definately a better alternative to the credit card rates I would have to pay if i took a cash advance.  Also, it gives me a piece of mind that i would know that the most i would have to pay is a set amount every month with the option of prepaying more if i wanted to.  I currently have a salary of $85K of which i get a net paycheck of $4,400 a month.  So my cashflow is still good even with this loan.

The potential application of this design concept is huge, and currently there is nothing like it in the marketplace.  It enables the interchangeability (transform/morph) of different art, quotations, and graphic expressions on display.  After the design patent was granted in 2008, I slowly and gradually worked on preparing to get the brand off the ground.  This year, after sourcing materials and getting other resources in place, the 1st and 2nd prototypes are finally completed, with the 2nd improving by leaps and bound over the first.  To date, I have invested over $10K of my own capital into this venture, not to mention countless hours of work, and I enjoy every minute of it.  The loan will be used to take the venture into the next level by mostly funding the first production batch of denim jeans.  This production batch will anchor the first of many distribution channel by way of the MorphBrand.com website (currently under construction), and major apparel trade shows in the spring of 2010.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>",2803

My financial situation:  I have a full time job as a finacial consultant with a well funded company.    My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.  Also,  t he probability of additonal sites opening and  being funded by the existing  operations will increase the future returns and more than be worth the tax deductible interest for this loan that I am asking you to fund.  Thank you in advance for reading this and helping me with this project.

This refi wraps up a year of selling too-expensive cars, paying off other debt, refinancing the house, and otherwise getting my act together.<br/><br/>I have been employed by the same firm for nearly seven years and am in a very stable position. Further, as noted below, the terms of my employment dictate that I maintain a minimum credit rating and not default on any debt. I hope you will consider me for your investment; please let me know if you have any questions.<br/>",725

My oldest daughter had some personal issues that as a mother I could not turn her away, so I helped her. In  helping her I aquired debt on my credit cards. Additionally there were medical problems that my insurance company did not cover or they only paid a certain percentage. I was forced to put the balances on my cards. It has been a very difficult time, but I am deteremined to make it through. I appreciate any help that can be given. I have always honored my debts and have always strived to do the best with what I have been given. I have never, nor do I ever intend to file bankruptcy.

I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked.

This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.  My sister is determined to keep her career which she has worked so hard to build and I am doing what I can to help her.  I would deeply appreciate an understanding of the unfortunate circumstances of the situation and any willingness to help.",2344

I would like to pay this before it negatively affects my credit. I am expecting my first child and putting multiple bills into one payment would provide a huge stress relief. I would like to get into my own home soon for my family and would not like any negative hits on my credit and this loan would help me do just that. I gross in roughly $2400 a month. After paying rent and utilities and making the minimum payments on the credit cards with the revolving interest it is hard to get back on top. Plus I make my monthly payments to the apartments to stop it from hitting my credit and my bi-weekly payments to the payday loan.

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.",1669

I have been blessed with a beautiful wife and 2 fantastic daughters.  My wife (Rosalie) and I were married in a house with 10 friends present.  While it was memorable- it wasn't the wedding that every girl dreams of having.  I promised my wife that one day she would get that wedding.  That time has come... the big day is jsut 3 weeks away!  We have been able to pay for almost everything, but we are finding that the last minute expenses are turning out to be a little more than we anticipated.  We are seeking some help to take the worry off our shoulders- allowing us to enjoy this moment without the stresses of money being present.  The $3000 we are seeking to borrow would be going towards the balance due to the caterer, the flowers (we are frugal and have decided to get the flowers from Costco), bridal hair and make-up, and the wedding favors for the guests.  Please know that paying this loan back would be a top priority for me.  I don't take borrowing lightly.  At this moment the time is short as the balances are due in about 10 days.

At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us. And that is why I am here, so that our company will continue to realize the success which it has had for 25 years.    Please feel free to ask any questions. I will gladly provide any additional details you may require.    Thank you for your consideration.   We have recently incorporated a new division of our company in Nevada, to take advantage of the better tax structure, and to be closer to our clients.  This will save us thousands of dollars each year on taxes, and help expand the business. The current business climate is also improving, as the economy and world markets stabilize. All of this is good news for us -- as long as we have capital to take advantage of our growth opportunities. This is the main reason for contacting Lending Club, and seeking this short-term loan.<br/> Borrower added on 05/22/10 > I was recently notified by my Credit Keeper account that as of May 18, 2010, my FICO score is at 750. I thought that members of the Lending Club, who may be interested in investing in this current loan, would like to know that. I hope this demonstrates that even under adverse conditions I am able to keep my business and personal accounts in good order, and that I always maintain my obligations in a timely manner. <br/><br/>Our company has been in business for a long time, and throughout the current economic climate -- and the credit crunch that has made business advancement difficult -- we have still maintained all activities in a professional manner. We are able to continue, and to advance, and -- with the support of the members of the Lending Club -- we will prevail. Thank you for being a part of our future.<br/> Borrower added on 05/24/10 > Here is some additional information about our company, and the work we do.<br/><br/>We are in the marketing research and consulting business. Our main task is to speak with customers, and ask them about their experiences. We ask them what they like, what they don't like -- and why. There are many different aspects to this marketing research, but in a nutshell we provide direct-from-the-customer data, and opinions, which our clients then use to improve service. <br/><br/>As the economy is improving, new areas of potential business are opening in many parts of the US, which also means that our clients are stepping up their marketing research activities. This is good for our business as we seek these opportunities, and continue to build upon them.<br/>",3499

About 5 years ago I was still moving up in the company I work for. My husband was laid off in his job with an adverstising firm. We had a lot of school loans, credit card debt, etc. When we were younger we did not make the best decisions on purchases and spending. Like a lot of young people, we had lots of credit card debt and were in over our heads. We could make payments on the credit cards when we were both working, though we were not making a lot of headway in paying them down. Then when my husband lost his job we took on more debt just to stay afloat. We missed a lot of payments. <br/>Over the last 5 years I have moved up in my job and now make around $90,000 a year. My husband makes between $55,000 and $75,000, depending on the amount of overtime he gets during the year. In the last few years my husband and I have dug ourselves out of over $80,000 in debt. <br/>All we have now is a house payment at $1,100/15 years, his truck payment $360/month 2 1/2 years remaining, and an old personal loan $157/month &ndash; matures 2014 at 8%. <br/>It has just been in this last year that we finally got to this point. Then this happens. I don&rsquo;t have the $12,000+ saved up to fix the small flood in my front yard. (I asked for $14,000 as I will have to have my walk path re-poured and don&rsquo;t know exactly how much that will cost.) I really can&rsquo;t wait another 6-8 months to save the money to get this fixed. I really need to get it fixed in the next few weeks before it gets really bad. <br/>I can&rsquo;t tell you how badly I do not want to take on this loan. I don&rsquo;t want to be back in debt but do not have a choice. We have checked with several banks and they will lend us the money, since we have such great income. But because of all of the past debt we had where we were late on our payments (when my husband had no job and I was only making around $35,000 a year) they want to loan it to us at 23-25%. If that is my only choice I will have to accept it. But, my husband encouraged me to give it a few days and try this site since the interest rate is lower. I am very nervous about getting a loan in this manner but he says &ldquo;have faith&rdquo; and see what this brings. So here I am, having faith, and asking for people to take a chance and invest in me.<br/>",2611

However, throughout my college years (6 years to get my Doctor of Pharmacy!), I accumulated a great deal of debt, mainly from heavy personal spending and heavy credit card use. (Side note: NO Student Loans! thanks to my wonderful parents). I've since grown financially wise and level, but the past is haunting me, and I want this debt GONE ASAP. It's time to erase it for good. I'm sick of the rude credit card companies and interest rates that keep slowly creeping up. I am looking for $20,000 to combine and erase a ~$15,000 balance, ~$4000 balance, and ~$1000 balance on 3 different accounts. The loan WILL be paid back in 3 years or very likely less.

I had a 730 according to Equifax earlier this summer last I looked. So I pulled another credit report just to check. Turns on I am still an &quot;authorized user&quot; on my parent's Bank of America credit card. It had been dormant and $0 for a couple years, but my dad just very recently transferred $10k+ to because of a good interest rate, and it popped up on my credit. Yuck. He's working on removing me as a user ASAP, but for the time being, my current revolving credit balance is a little higher than my true debt. Thanks again!<br/>",1489

While this has been a topic that we frequently discussed, I thought she was reluctant for me to ""pull the trigger"" because we currently live in different cities (about an hour an half apart) and I thought she wanted to wait until we live together. However, she recently made it clear she's eager to get engaged. (Or maybe I've been missing subtle clues for a while.) In any event, I know it would be more meaningful for her if I were to ask during the holidays. Unfortunately, that didn't leave me with sufficient time to have available what I'd like to budget. So I have turned to Lending Club to make this happen. I've been employed as an attorney with the same firm for the last five years and am happy to answer any additional questions.<br/>",858

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.   I have a base salary of $35,000 from the facility that I am based out of and had commissions paid in the amount of $6600 in January and $9000 in February. My gross income for 2007 was $85,000 with a base salary of $20,000 and commissions of $65,000 for the year.   If you notice on my credit report, I have not missed a payment on any debt. I wish to keep it that way and am looking for a loan to consolidate some of the monthly payments and reduce the total amount of my long-term debt. I hope to find someone to help me achieve my financial goals.",1575

We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

When we first started planning, we decided that we wanted to wake up the day after our wedding having paid for it entirely, without any debt.  After analyzing our finances, we realized we needed a little help to reach our goal.  Our parents graciously volunteered to contribute $10,000 to our wedding.  However, as a result of the recent tumble of the stock market and housing markets, our parents are no longer able to help us pay for our wedding.    We don't want to cancel the wedding, as we've already paid $3,000 in deposits, and have friends and family who have already purchased plane tickets.  We decided instead to cut the guest list and trim back the menu, cut out luxuries like an open bar and fancy flower arrangements, and have reneogitated our contract with the venue and caterer.  As a result, we have managed to scale back our budget by 25%.    There are still some things that we really do not want to cut out, such as paying my grandmother's hotel and airfare so she can attend, as she wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise, and helping our parents with their plane tickets.    We plan to allocate $4,500 to actual expenses, and reserve $1,500 for emergencies.  Any cash we do not use will be paid back immediately.  We both have good, steady jobs, and would be able to pay back all principle and interest due in 3 years or less.    A loan to help us our with our special day would be greatly appreciated!",1478

One of the cards has an approximate balance of $9500.  I closed that account, which may have hurt my credit, but I will never have anything to do with Chase or any business affiliated with them.  At least not knowingly.  In four months time, from the time they took over the account from Washington Mutual, they raised my percentage rate twice, forced me to make two payments in one month, charged me a late fee and then reduced my credit limit, which was the final straw for me. The remaining amount of the loan will be placed into my savings account as part of my emergency fund. My significant other of 11 years lost his job a year ago in a reorganization.  He was fortunate to find another job, but for less pay.  Due to the economy, there is less work and the company has cut back on hours.  Since April of this year, his paychecks cover only child support.  I believe in keeping a savings account to cover at least 3-6 months of household expenses or as an emergency fund, which I have had to tap into during the past year. Paying the monthly bills is not a problem but adding to savings has not been easy. This loan will permit me to continue to pay the bills and add to the savings.

About 2 years ago I got laid off from my job and was without a full time job for approximately a year.  At this time, one month before I got laid off, I signed a new one year lease for my apartment.  I worked part time at a local restaurant to pay off bills etc while looking for a full time job.  At this point, I started falling behind on my bills and hence the debt on my 2 credit cards.  I now have a very stable job and I am working on a program that is funded for the next 30 years.  I am a very responsible person and I've never had a late payment on any of my loans.  I would be grateful in getting this loan as it will help to improve my credit score and put me in a better position to buy a house in the near future.  I hope you consider helping me out.  Thanks!",982

I have a great, stable computer programming job that I've been at for over 10 years. I currently have a $1,350 mortgage payment. This line of credit and mortgage are the only debts I have.  I've never missed a payment on anything in my life, and intend to keep it that way. Thanks.<br/>",1160

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: <br/>1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years <br/>2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) <br/>3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom <br/>4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.   Thanks!",2533

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

As a recent College graduate, I have a full life ahead of me to work, earn, spend and save. However, I have only one day, one moment, to stand at the end of the aisle and watch the love of my life walk down it to marry me.  I am marrying my high school sweetheart and girlfriend of eight years this fall.   I do not live above my means, and place a high priority on paying off my debts. I have never defaulted on any loan of any sort, and am currently (and successfully) paying off my student loans.??  I plan on having 150-175 guests at my wedding. While I already have about 30% of the total wedding budget saved or paid (down payments), before I send invitations out I need to know that the wedding can actually be paid for.  While I very well may earn enough to pay for the entire wedding by November, this is not an event to gamble on.??  I need this loan in order to have the peace of mind to invite our guests to the wedding without worrying about whether or not I will actually have the cash in hand to pay for it.  This is my first experience with peer to peer lending, and I am very excited about the possibilities it presents for both the Lender and the Borrower.

Prior to turning 17 I worked part time from the age of 13.  I held my first real job at a Market Research firm for 10 years.  I worked my way up from telemarketer to Marketing Director eventually landing in Honolulu HI running a branch office.  When that office closed, I went to work for Nextel Communications and was a Customer Relations Manager for about 2 years before moving to CA.  Since living in CA I have had 2 jobs, the first as Operations Manager for an IT Outsourcing company (2 years) and most recently as a Data Analyst with a Telecom Expense Management firm where I have been employed for the past 2.5 years.  There are no gaps in my employment history and I have never been without a job.   I currently have 8 debtors, which includes 7 credit cards at decent interest rates and a small line of credit for overdraft protection.  I have paid off a home mortgage, and 6-8 auto loans with no late payments or fees.  I have never bounced a check, missed a payment, or had any liens against me.  The only issue with my credit report is the credit cards for which I am seeking this loan to pay off, all of which are up to date and in good standing.  My take home pay is about $3K a month.  I have monthly expenses of about $1815($800 rent, $200 car payment, $65 insurance, $150 utilities, currently paying $600+ on credit cards).  My goal is to pay off my credit cards and close all but one of them with this loan.  The remaining credit card I plan on making $150 payments on until paid off.  I would like to purchase another home in 4-5 years once this debt is paid up.  I do have access to family funds and a second income from my partner in the event of any emergencies.  I also have $6K in savings to fall back on.  I am very proud of my credit and payment history and would never do anything to damage my credit.  The majority of this credit card debt was accrued 10+ years ago and I am currently living well within my means.  My problem is that since I have such a large amount of credit card debt banks will not issue me a consolidation loan despite my flawless payment history.  If you invest in me I will not let you down.  If you have any additional questions or concerns please ask away.  Thank you for your consideration.<br/>",2397

This loan will consolidate a handful of debts I am already paying regularly without fail. This one loan payment will simply replace all the payments I am currently making on the debts I've chosen to include in this figure. (I have not included a couple as their rates are already great and I'm making fast progress there.) I just want to accelerate my overall pay-off progress a bit by shaving a few more percentage points off interest rates and having a fixed schedule for pay-off. I have done this a couple of times already with terrific success.  Over the past several years, I have turned my financial life around penny by penny. I went from having a very low FICO, twice as much debt and several derogatory credit marks due to an isolated personal hardship, to cleaning up everything through perseverance, sacrifice and hard work. I am incredibly proud of myself and confident in my ability to become debt free in just a few more years!  My partner is self-employed and work is slow right now. We are not in trouble yet, but I want to be proactive about ""tightening up the ship"" and not spending money where I don't have to. That includes high interest rates on debt. We are already limiting our spending to necessary items. Rest assured, I am very serious about fulfilling my obligations to lenders. Financial health is my #1 priority.",1370

I was able to pay the minimum each month but then the interest on the cards started to edge up one after the other, I found myself swimming against the tide.

I make enough in my current job that I can certainly afford loan payments, but would have to wait quite a while to save up enough to pay for my educational expenses up front. In the current economy, only the wealthy and the destitute(the only ones who qualify for much financial aid) can afford to go to school using the more traditional payment types. Because I make enough to live on, I don't have the opportunity to better myself without seeking a loan.   My credit history and score are reasonably good, and hopefully will be improving more in the coming years. I always make payments on time, and usually pay more than the minimum, because I don't really like being in debt. Also, the job info. on this site won't really give a good idea of how much I actually make. I recently (January of this year) got a job with the state of CT. In order to accomodate the schedule for it, I dropped myself down to on-call status with my other employer Sunrise Northeast, for whom I've worked for over 5 years. I take extra hours as a I please with both jobs, and therefore make 2-3 times my base pay, which is only about 1200 per month, pretax. Since I am able to take on more time, within certain limits of course, I can work more to pay for extras such as vacation, without sacrificing paying my bills.

It has worsened to a point that my eyes can no longer be fitted with glasses or contacs.  my only option is to have a corneal cross-linking done to stabilize the cornea, then either a lens implant or lens transplant to allow my eyes to be fitted properly.  If I do not have the procedure, then I am faced with the inconvenience of not being able to see clearly and place my career of choice for over 20 years on the line.  As a teacher, I am continuously transitioning from close vision to far away and the keratakonis keeps me from having that clarity. <br/>Unfortunately, this medical procedure is quite expensive and not covered by insurance.  Also, due to my home location, travel and lodging for re-coup time and follow up appointments almost double the cost of the operation.  I do not have that kind of expendable cash, thus am asking for assistance.  Any money received that is not needed for my surgery will be used to pay other eye doctor appointment costs that were out-of-pocket for consultation, etc. <br/>Thank you so much for any  and all assistance you can provide.  I am a good risk, pay my bills on time and have secure employment with tenure.  Have a wonderful day!  strandisa  :)<br/> Borrower added on 04/10/10 > I would like to add that I also pick up extra jobs that I use to supplement general daily living expenses and at times I have needed to put that money towards bills if I happened to have a short month.  I tutor students privately outside of school for $40 dollars per hour, rent out a room when short-term visitors come to Nome on a special occasion or assignment, and I did have a roommate for three years, but she recently moved out, thus the main reason why my debt increased.  I just wanted to point out that although the budget I submitted appears very tight on paper, there are always options for me to utilize in helping financially, thus there's actually a god amount of ""wiggle"" room.  thank you!!  Have a super day!!  strandisa33  : )<br/> Borrower added on 04/14/10 > Dear investors...thank you soooo much for your contribution to making my loan successful.  I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a ""pay it forward"" philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.  Anyway...I have no words that go deep enough to express how much I appreciate your generosity.  I promise you that you will not be sorry and will be paid in full as soon as I am able.  God bless you!!  Fondly,  Susan  ;)<br/>null",3694

We have already purchased three buses that will be used in our business.

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etc’‘Î¢’Ç’_’Ç_ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, ’‘Î¢’Ç’_’Ç’Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎ, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>",2149

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.  I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with yoy.",2884

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance.

I have been a faithful customer and have never once missed a payment on a debt, but high interest rates have kept them nearly impossible to pay off. I got in trouble back in college before I knew what damage credit cards could do, and haven't been able to dig my way out. I recently cut up every credit card I had; this was an amazing feeling! I have a B.A. in Psychology and am currently employed by the state of Missouri as a Youth Specialist. I work in a moderate security treatment center to help rehabilitate young men who have had some trouble with the law. I love my job and plan to stick with it as a career. I also substitute teach for the local public school system on the days that I don't work at the treatment center, which is a nice bit of additional income. I hope to get rid of my credit cards so I can buy a house before too long. My girlfriend (soon to be fiance) would like me to have control over my credit situation before we move in together, so I am hoping this will be one of the solutions! Thank you so much!   One final note: I have watched Dave Ramsey's DVDs and am already following his suggestions. I used my tax return to pay off my two credit cards with the lowest balances. This loan will be used for the remainder. I will add about $75 to the minimum monthly payment of this loan, which is what I was paying on those other two. This should expedite the payoff process.<br/> Borrower added on 03/15/11 > Okay, another note: I had my student loan payments reduced and I will be throwing the difference at this loan as well, which should mean an additional $80 a month. Again, I am incredibly serious about getting rid of my credit cards. This needs to happen. Thanks!<br/>",1844

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon. Thanks!<br/>",2424

The company has been in business for over 20 years and is BBB (Better Business Bureau) accredited.   The seller is re-locating out of state and has agreed to owner financing at a favorable rate and favorable terms.<br/><br/>I am using my own funds for the down payment, I am asking for $14,000 from investors for the following:<br/><br/>-Advertising campaign:  The company does no advertising.  I plan to use approximately 25% of the investor supplied funds to run an initial advertising campaign in local newspapers, the internet (Google, Yahoo, and Service Magic), and direct mailing.  After the initial advertising campaign, 5% of revenue will be used for advertising.<br/><br/>-Update the company’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎés electronic equipment:  The electronic equipment the company uses can only be described as antiquated.  Paperwork that is currently presented to the prospective customer is hand written hard copy.  I will use 20% of investor supplied funds to purchase a field laptop, portable printer, and necessary software.  The impact on a prospective customer of a hand written proposal vs. a color, graphical electronic printout is well worth the cost.  <br/><br/>-Company Image:  I will use 20% of the investor supplied funds to update the company image.  The company does not have a website so a website will need to be developed and hosted.  Business cards, printed brochures, folders will need to be purchased also.  The company has no uniforms.  Uniforms for the crew and evaluator will give the company a more professional appearance.<br/><br/> The truck the company uses to haul the crew and heavy duty equipment is 14 years old.  It runs well but the appearance leaves much to be desired.  I will have the truck painted.  I will also have the company logo and contact information printed on the truck.  The company trailer will get the same treatment.<br/><br/>-Job materials: 20% of investor supplied funds will be set aside materials that will need to be purchased to complete the first job.<br/><br/>-The remaining investor supplied funds will be used for miscellaneous expenses that will arise during ownership transition such as legal fees.<br/><br/>I do not intend to fundamentally change the way the company does business.  The company has been in business for many years and has had success; they do quality work at a reasonable price.  I want to give the company a more professional appearance and expand on its success through advertising and public awareness.<br/>",2610

I typically pay more than the minimum due but the interest rates and annual fees keep going up and the banks continue to lower my credit line.  This is impacting my debt to credit ratio, which is further impacting my credit score.<br/><br/>Stability:  I've been employed with the same company for 15 years and work in IT.  I have 2 savings accounts and a 401(k) plan that I could easily tap into and pay off all my credit card debt but that would be a last resort.  I want to stay on track with building my emergency funds and retirement savings and at the same time make regular monthly payments against my debt so I can build upon my credit worthiness.<br/><br/>The Numbers:  Currently, my monthly budget allocates $500 towards credit card payments.  The $328 monthly payment on this consolidation loan is set at a lower APR, which enables me to pay off my credit card debt in just 3 years.  At the rate I'm going, it would take at least 7 years to pay them off (longer if they continue to hike up their rates and fees!)  The $172 difference will be deposited into savings.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your support!<br/>",1254

The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal ""you give me money, I say thanks and make payments"" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctorŠ—ç’_Îés bills and auto repairs from last year.

Our incomes are both strong and we have worked hard to build a great credit history of steady, reliable repayment over the past three years in particular.   Because credit scores don't tell the whole story, we would ask that you look at how well and how long our repayment history is on a variety of loans.  We own our own home, which is valued by the county assessor this past January at $183,000. One building on the property is planned for income producing this year.  My photography business is strong with an expected gross sales in 2009 to exceed $60,000.  My husband's income with MPRI is $168,000/year, which I manage for him since his work is overseas in Iraq. I can provide paystubs if necessary or needed.   Since we are married, our incomes are obviously intertwined, which is why I'm asking for consideration of both incomes.

My name is Roberto and I am currently a 24-year old medical student at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I am a kind and smart guy that is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon.  In the past (2006) I used Prosper to borrow money to fix up my 1971 Chevrolet Nova Muscle Car and was very pleased with the experience.  I borrowed $3,000 and paid it off in 12 months.  I am now seeking $10,750 to invest in U.S. equities and will be paying off my loan in 36 months.  I am an extremely hard working guy that was top of my class in college.  I am a very low risk borrower as I have NEVER been late on a credit card payment or peer-to-peer lending payment.  I have a lot going for me and will not risk messing up my credit or reputation by being late on any payments to a lender.  I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at http://www.pdsoros.org/current_fellows/   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over $23,000 in cash, all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around $30,000, owe $8000 on my credit cards (that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of $2500/month, I only use $1700 of it, does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score), go to medical school on a near full-ride, and have positive cash flow exceeding $800/month after all my expenses are taken into account.  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor.  Her income will cover groceries, gas, and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over $1100/month starting this fall. I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer.  You may ask why I have $8,000 in credit card debt when I have $23,000 in cash and $30,000 in assets?  That is because I have a 0% APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now.  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring, we have paid for the honeymoon, and our parents are paying for the wedding. I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0% APR deal ends I will pay the cards off.  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this $10,750 loan.   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities.  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing. This enormous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression, has left good companies (in infrastructure, tech, agriculture, shipping) trading at a fraction of what they were.  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every U.S. economic crisis in history.  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of $10,000 and turned it into $20,000 through learning to manage risk with stops, investing on a mixture of momentum, news, technical analysis, and fundamentals, not letting emotion, greed, or fear make me hold losing positions, learning to sell my losses and ride my gains, etc.  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 (2004 BMW 330Ci).  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon (next couple years) has once again convinced me to start to move some money ($5,000) back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already.  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan.",3966

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.

Consolidating the loans would lower our monthly payments as well as allowing us to divert that extra money towards child care costs, and perhaps also towards building our emergency fund which we had greatly neglected for the longest time.<br/>The new plan now is to pay off unsecured debt, build up our emergency fund and hopefully still have extra cash to put into another investment while still living comfortably within our means, especially with the new addition to our family.<br/> Borrower added on 01/28/10 > To answer other potential questions:<br/><br/>Monthly bills: 1820 for mortgage, 370 for HOA, about 150 for cable/internet, 150 for a family cell phone plan, about 145 for school loans (took some additional classes for Accounting certification), about 40 to 100 for electricity (depending on the season). <br/><br/>Credit card balances/interest rates are as follows:<br/>Citi - 4,562.22 @ 14.990<br/>Amex - 2,042.24 @ 15.210<br/>Wells Fargo - 1,918.61 @ 6.65 (just want to pay this balance off already)<br/>*Have other balances on department store cards which I am paying off separately this month, totalling approximately $800.<br/><br/>I have a spouse but we chose to keep our finances (and debt) separate except for the mortgage, HOA, phone bill and property tax.

I currently have credit card debt totaling $2,433.55 and an auto loan of $2603.00. I will utilize the funds from this loan to consolidate my debt. I currently earn $33,000/year (base) plus commissions. With commission I earn $38,000/year. I currently live in a home with my fianc’‘’Ü’ÇÎ© who pays the mortgage. I am responsible for the utility bills, and the grocery shopping. The only other debt I have, other than the aforementioned auto loan and credit cards, is a student loan of $18,000 that requires a monthly payment of $114.00 at an interest rat of 4.2%. I currently net $2000.00 per month. With this loan the consistent monthly payments I would have would include: $114.00 student loan; $203.00 lending club loan; $60.00 cell phone bill; ~$200.00 utilities & internet and $53.00 car insurance. Other common expenses include: ~$250.00 groceries and $80.00 gas. The reason I am sharing this with you, potential investor, is to assure you that I have the proper funds to repay you. I know if I was investing in a person I did not know, I would want as much information as possible. To be able to reduce the amount of interest I am paying on my current debt would truly lift a weight off of my shoulders, and would allow me to see the end point of my payments.

This is a badly needed move for us, as my husband has been unemployed for over two years now, ever since the company he was working for closed all offices and moved out of state.  After such a extended period of unemployment, and despite several major cuts in our living expenses, the savings we had two years ago have been exhausted, and although this move would mean a much more secure financial home for us and our two young children, we don't have the capital to pay for our move.<br/><br/>If this posting looks familiar, it is because it already has been posted.  There was a mistake on my credit repot that caused the credit department to remove the loan.  After discovering the error, I fixed it and we are now trying this process again.  The original request was for $7500, but since that posting, we have had money come in from an unexpected source, so we are able to drop the amount of the loan.<br/><br/>We now have the rental truck paid for along with our estimated costs for hotel, food, and gas.  What this money would be used for is the associated costs of setting up our new home.  We have an apartment reserved for us, but we need to pay a deposit on it as well as possible deposits on utility services.  We will also need to buy groceries to restock the pantry and refrigerator.  In addition, there will be approximately a 3-week gap between when my paychecks from my old job end and when my first paycheck from my new position arrives.  That last &quot;old&quot; paycheck will pay the rent for the month, but not any of the other living expenses of the month.<br/><br/>Please consider helping us with our situation!  I have never defaulted on a financial obligation in my life, even when I had to make sacrifices to fulfill my responsibilities, and you will get every penny of your money back, plus your interest.  With the new position, and the decreased rent (due to geographic factors as well as scaling down from a 3BR apartment to a 2BR apartment) we will be paying, we will have an increase in our available cash flow each month more than 5 times our loan payment.<br/>",2224

I would move the $4,500 in credit debt to that card which guarantees a 3% rate on balance transfers for 5 years.   I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.  And then because of the new zero balance on the bank line of credit the remainder of the vehicle loan could be transferred to that line of credit.

Thankfully, I was able to pick up more hours at job #2 to cover bills, etc, but now I have to pay health insurance on my own since I am not full time at either job.  I have recently had a medical emergency, and accrued a little credit card debt trying to cover my regular monthly bills, health insurance, &amp; unexpected medical bills.  <br/><br/>I'm doing all I can, and have been doing great so far juggling this all alone, but I need to pay off the only credit card I have before it gets me in too deep.  I have moved in with my boyfriend who is not asking for a dime towards rent, utilities, or groceries so that I can put all my money and efforts towards getting these debts paid off quicker than ever.<br/><br/>It would be such a great relief and help to be able to do this!

I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.  Lindsey co-directs GoGoVertigoat Dance Project (www.gogovertigoat.org). They have shows upcoming at BoCoCa Arts Festival in Brooklyn, Dance New Amsterdam's fall Raw Material, and Movement Research's Judson Church.

We're a happily married couple (17 years) with children, and we're seeking a loan to eliminate our credit card debt. For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.   Thank you!",1812

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.  By borrowing against my Pension I will receive the 7% interest being paid to above credit cards. I have excellent credit. I want to keep it that way.  Thank you for your consideration.",2234

First, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I don’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎét have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave Ramsey’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎés Financial Peace University course.  In case you’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎére not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where ’‘Î¢’Ç’_’Ç’every dollar is spent before the month begins.’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎ  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.  Thanks for reading, and I look forward to working with you.",3425

Even though I had savings to pay for the renovations, I ended up spending more than I anticipated. I ended up using my credit cards and financing some of my big purchases. I am not very concerned about my credit card, because I am negotiating with the credit card companies to lower the interest rates. What I would like to do is pay off the cards that has promotional period ending soon(approx $5,000) to avoid paying accrued interest. My total debt is about $20,000 and $5,000 of this amount need to be paid very soon. I will spend the remaining loan to pay the high interest credit cards. I've been working for a state university for 3 years. I make $2,600 a month after tax.  I have always paid full amount on my credit cards until this big home renovation project. Now that the house is completely done, I am back to a more conservative spending pattern. I will definitely pay the loan back as scheduled.   I bought a house about 8 months ago and renovated the entire house. Even though I've paid most of the expenses from savings, I had to use my credit cards more than I anticipated. Now, I want to pay my off my credit cards and get back to my normal life. Before the renovations started I've been a very responsible person and always paid the full amount on my credit cards. I just need some additional cash to make the final payments. <br/>I've been working for a state university for 3 years and I see myself working there for a long time. Now that the renovations in my house is all completed, I won't have any problems paying this loan back to you. The amount of money I will save by not paying ridiculous amount of credit card fees and high interest rates will make it even easier for me to get back on my feet.<br/><br/>I make about $2,600  a month after taxes/fees. I live with my fiancee and he shares the expenses with me. So, I don't think I will have any problems paying my loan back.<br/>Thank you.<br/>",2020

The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan ""B"" was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan ""C"" is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan ""C"".

As you can see I can pay this debt off on my own, but I would rather pay the interest to people like you and me than to the banks that wouldn't let me consolidate these cards.

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in ""context"" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollarŠ—ç’_Îés ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who readŠ—ç’__ well I wonŠ—ç’_Îét digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!",2404
